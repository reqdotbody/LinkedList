##Setting up the Database Locally
1. You'll need to make sure that you have postgres installed. (http://www.postgresql.org/)
2. You'll need to run the postgres server
  a. You can do this from the app (http://postgresapp.com/)
  b. Or, you should be able to run "postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres" to start up your server via the command line.
3. You'll then need to start up the postgres (client) terminal interface. You can do this by running "psql" from the command line in another tab.
